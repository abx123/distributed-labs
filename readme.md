- encryption - encrypt and decrpyt plain text using AES and making sure the input matches the output.
- hash - hashes the plain text using KECCAK256 1000 times, ensuring the hashed value is as expected every time.
- signature - generates key pair, signs the plain text using ECDSA using the private key generated, then verifying the signature using the public key generated.
- keys - calculate number of unique keys and time taken to brute force keys in 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4196 bit sequence.
